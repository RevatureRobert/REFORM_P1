# REFORM_P1

## Project Description

REFORM is a lightweight, easy to use ORM Framework that supports programmatic persistence of POJOs. REFORM maps relational data sources to a corresponding relational database model, all without the developer needing to know SQL. 

## Technologies Used

* Java - version 8
* Maven - version 3.6.3
* PostGreSQL - version 42.2.19
* JDBC Api
* AWS RDS
* Dbeaver
* H2
* Jacoco - version 0.7.7
* Mockito - version 2.0.2


## Features

* Programmatic persistence of entities (basic CRUD support) utilizing annotations
* Basic transaction management (begin, commit, savepoint, rollback)
* Connection Pooling
* Multithreading support for executing queries
* Eagerly loaded database upon creation
* Autogenerated primary keys for maintaining relational integrity
* Supports PostgreSQL/MySQL databases

To-do list:
* Add functionality for mapping one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
* Allow for file-based configuration of entities (XML)
* Allow for session caching to optimize query execution

## Getting Started

```
> git clone https://github.com/RevatureRobert/REFORM_P1.git
> ls (Unix/Mac OS)
> dir (Windows)
```
To check that the repo was cloned correctly, you should see REFORM_P1 within the list of directories and files
```
> cd REFORM_P1/reform
> mvn clean install
> cd target
```
The packaged JAR file should now be in your target directory. 

## Usage

> You can now include the REFORM framework in any maven project by adding the following dependency in the pom.xml of any project you wish to incorporate REFORM into.
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.reform</groupId>
  <artifactId>Reform</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

> Configure the db.properties file located in ```REFORM_P1/reform/src/main/resources``` to add credentials to the database  you plan to utilize. 
> You're now ready to use REFORM!
> Mark any POJO you wish to map with an @entity annotation and on the next runtime, you should see your persisted entities now in your database
